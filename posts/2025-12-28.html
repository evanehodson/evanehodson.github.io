<p>I was hoping to use a consensus GPX file as the source of terrain data. But messing around with it for even a short while showed me that that would be more trouble than its worth. So, I'm changing course. I'm going to try using OpenStreetMaps trail polylines for the course lat and lon points and DEM for elevation. This will hopefully be more accurate and allow for more robust visualization!</p>
