## Motivation
While pacing and finishing time prediction have been extensively studied in standard track and road races (Foster et al., 1993; Joyner, 1991), ultramarathons remain comparatively underexplored despite their rapid growth in participation (Hoffman & Krishnan, 2014; Knechtle & Nikolaidis, 2018). This research gap is particularly significant given the unique challenges these events present: highly variable terrain and the complex accumulation of fatigue over extended durations make traditional race models inadequate for ultra-distance prediction (Millet et al., 2011; Scheer et al., 2020).

## Theoretical Framework
The endurance running literature has converged on a well-established understanding: performance at any given moment in a race is determined by three interacting factors **terrain**, **fitness**, and **fatigue** (Joyner & Coyle, 2008; Millet et al., 2011).

**Terrain** reflects the immediate mechanical and metabolic demands imposed by gradient and surface conditions. Changes in slope substantially alter energy cost and muscle recruitment patterns, particularly through the contrasting concentric demands of uphill running and eccentric braking demands of downhill running (Minetti et al., 2002; Vernillo et al., 2017).

**Fitness** represents an athlete’s physiological capacity, most notably their lactate threshold and aerobic power, which together establish a baseline sustainable pace. Lactate threshold speed has repeatedly been shown to be a strong predictor of endurance performance across race distances, including marathons and ultra-endurance events (Coyle, 1995; Joyner & Coyle, 2008; Garbisu-Hualde & Santos-Concejero, 2021).

**Fatigue** captures the progressive degradation of performance capacity over time, driven by metabolic, neuromuscular, and central factors. Prolonged endurance exercise leads to measurable declines in running economy, maximal aerobic capacity, and force production, particularly in ultra-distance contexts (Millet et al., 2011; Saugy et al., 2013).

While each factor in isolation provides limited explanatory power, their interaction captures the dominant dynamics of ultramarathon performance. Empirical analyses of ultramarathon pacing demonstrate that performance outcomes are strongly shaped by how athletes modulate effort in response to terrain while managing accumulating fatigue relative to their physiological capacity (Abbiss & Laursen, 2008; Vernillo et al., 2020). This decomposition therefore finds strong empirical support in prior work linking course gradient, physiological capacity, and pacing strategies in long-distance running.

## Data and Technical Capacity
Recent advances in data collection and computational methods now enable rigorous modeling of these components. The key data sources include:
- High-resolution GPS traces from ultramarathon courses (sub-100 m resolution)
- Digital elevation models (DEMs) enabling upscaling to approximately 10 m resolution for fine-grained terrain characterization
- Physiological data including pace, heart rate, and personal records (PRs) across standard distances
- Race performance data allowing for athlete-specific fitness and fatigue profiling

## Research Objectives
This work pursues three primary objectives:
1. Generate realistic race pacing plans that incorporate terrain and fatigue dynamics to achieve specified target finishing times
2. Predict finishing times from partial race data, enabling real-time pacing adjustments and expectation management during ongoing races
3. Estimate ultramarathon performance from flat-road PRs, translating standard distance achievements (5 km, 10 km, half-marathon, marathon) into ultra-distance predictions

## Development Philosophy
This project will be conducted in the spirit of open science, with regular development logs documenting the evolution of the model, changes in assumptions, and lessons learned from failures and successes alike. Each entry will serve as a transparent record of the research process, capturing not just what worked, but why certain approaches were pursued, modified, or abandoned.
